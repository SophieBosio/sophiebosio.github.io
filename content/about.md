I'm Sophie! I was born in Oslo in 1999, and after some moving back and forth
for my studies, I'm back in my home city.

I'm very interested in programming, coffee, natural languages, and music.

Currently, I'm working as a software engineer at [Ardoq](https://www.ardoq.com/).

I recently graduated with an MSc from the University of Oslo, where I wrote my thesis on [property-based
testing](https://medium.com/criteo-engineering/introduction-to-property-based-testing-f5236229d237). I designed and implemented a small functional language called [Contra](https://github.com/SophieBosio/contra), which has native support for defining properties and a built-in property-checker. It's capable of automatically generating counterexamples, even for user-defined algebraic data types, using SMT solving.

I implemented Contra in Haskell and at work, I'm getting to love Clojure.
I'm generally interested in functional programming languages - bonus if there's
a nice Emacs mode for it!

Besides programming languages, I am also known to occasionally nerd out about
natural languages. In addition to Norwegian and English, I speak French and
Italian reasonably well.
