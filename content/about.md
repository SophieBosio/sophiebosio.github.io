## <span class="org-todo done DONE">DONE</span> About {#about}

I'm Sophie! I was born in Oslo in 1999, and after some moving back and forth
for my studies, I'm back in my home city.

I'm very interested in programming, coffee, natural languages, and music.

Currently, I'm writing my MSc thesis, working part-time as a software engineer
intern at [Ardoq](https://www.ardoq.com/) and enjoying the wild ride of learning Emacs.

My thesis work is about trying to make [property-based
testing](https://medium.com/criteo-engineering/introduction-to-property-based-testing-f5236229d237) a little easier to get started with, by automatically generating test
input generators for you. Normally, you have to write generators for
user-defined algebraic data types yourself but in my small functional language Contra,
generators for simple ADTs are derived automatically.

My thesis work is in Haskell and at work, I'm learning more and more Clojure.
I'm generally interested in functional programming languages - bonus if there's
a nice Emacs mode for it!

Besides programming languages, I am also known to occasionally nerd out about
natural languages. In addition to Norwegian and English, I speak French and
Italian reasonably well.
