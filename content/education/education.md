## BSc {#bsc}

I have a bachelor's degree in [Cognitive Science](https://www.uib.no/en/studies/BASV-KOGNI) from the [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/), Norway.

The full course plan for the degree can be found at the university's websites,
but unfortunately, the [relevant plan](https://www.uib.no/infomedia/154615/tatt-opp-p%C3%A5-kogvit-f%C3%B8r-2022) (admission in 2019) is only available in
Norwegian.

Each course page does however have an English version. A brief overview is
provided below for the reader's convenience.
