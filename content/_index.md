**Hi! I'm Sophie, a master's student at the University of Oslo.**

I'm currently writing my MSc thesis, which is about using program
inversion to automatically derive good test input generators, hopefully making
tools such as QuickCheck even more appealing to the average programmer.

Besides functional programming, I'm a (budding) Emacs enthusiast with an
above-average interest in coffee. When I'm not learning programming languages,
I like to try my hand at learning natural ones.
