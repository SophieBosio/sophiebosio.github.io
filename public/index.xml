          I&amp;rsquo;m Sophie! I was born in Oslo in 1999, and after some moving back and forth for my studies, I&amp;rsquo;m back in my home city.
I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in programming, coffee, natural languages, and music.
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying the wild ride of learning Emacs and preparing to write my MSc thesis, which will be on using program inversion to simplify automatic testing. By inverting your program, I hope to derive a good generator for you that you can feed to QuickCheck to automatically test your program with property-based tests :~)

          BSc#I have a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Cognitive Science from the University of Bergen, Norway.
The full course plan for the degree can be found at the university&amp;rsquo;s websites, but unfortunately, the relevant plan (admission in 2019) is only available in Norwegian.
Each course page does however have an English version. A brief overview is provided below for the reader&amp;rsquo;s convenience.

          Monads are a special kind of mathematical structure. Technically (category theoretically) speaking, they can be defined quite succintly as &amp;ldquo;a monoid in the category of endofunctors&amp;rdquo;.
But what exactly does that mean? That question has been posed to Google by many a beginner to functional programming. And that in turn, is because monads are a very useful structure that actually makes our lives as functional programmer significantly easier! Once you get past the definition of a monad and you&amp;rsquo;re ready to actually use them, that is.

          This website is built with Hugo and ox-hugo, an exporting engine that lets me write my posts in Org mode and then put it online easily.
