          I&amp;rsquo;m Sophie! I was born in Oslo in 1999, and after some moving back and forth for my studies, I&amp;rsquo;m back in my home city.
I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in programming, coffee, natural languages, and music.
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying the wild ride of learning Emacs and preparing to write my MSc thesis, which will be on using program inversion to simplify automatic testing. By inverting your program, I hope to derive a good generator for you that you can feed to QuickCheck to automatically test your program with property-based tests :~)

          BSc#I have a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Cognitive Science from the University of Bergen, Norway.
The full course plan for the degree can be found at the university&amp;rsquo;s websites, but unfortunately, the relevant plan (admission in 2019) is only available in Norwegian.
Most of the course pages do however have an English version. A brief overview with links is provided below for the reader&amp;rsquo;s convenience. Programming languages used in the courses have been added in parentheses where relevant.

          Please note: This is a test &amp;ldquo;post&amp;rdquo; to see how different formatting in Org+Hugo works, it&amp;rsquo;s not a proper or finished post :~)
Monads are a special kind of mathematical structure. Technically (category theoretically) speaking, they can be defined quite succintly as &amp;ldquo;a monoid in the category of endofunctors&amp;rdquo;.
But what exactly does that mean? That question has been posed to Google by many a beginner to functional programming. And that in turn, is because monads are a very useful structure that actually makes our lives as functional programmer significantly easier!

          This website is built with Hugo and ox-hugo, an exporting engine that lets me write my posts in Org mode and then put it online easily.
