It can also be a little overwhelming to configure for the first time.\nOne of the many things that make Emacs great, though, is its dedicated and helpful user base. I hope to add a small contribution to that community with this post, going over what I would have told my past self as I was just starting out using Emacs and trying to write my first Emacs configuration file.\nI’ll assume you know the basics of editing with Emacs and won’t cover general concepts like major modes or how to save files in Emacs. I’ll primarily be focusing on how you can get started personalising it.\nBefore we get into it, I’d like to cover three things: (1) Emacs is a Lisp interpreter at heart, (2) there are great places to get help, and (3) you should try out pieces of other people’s configs.\nPreamble A Primer in Emacs and Elisp Emacs is often thought of as a text editor. While it is built around text editing and has many great packages to do so, I’d argue it’s more useful to think of it as an (Emacs) Lisp interpreter.\nYour configuration file is a program of Emacs Lisp (or “elisp” for short) code that modifies the behaviour of Emacs itself. Most of the behaviours of vanilla Emacs are written in Elisp, and the rest in C. Therefore, almost everything that Emacs does, you can change! You can, of course, add and create new functionality as well.\nThe power to build your ideal editor is right at your fingertips! As long as you’re willing to learn a little bit of a Lisp dialect.\nThankfully, Elisp is a pretty readable language and as long as you watch your parentheses, you’ll be fine.\nGet Help The Emacs community is very friendly and are often keep to help out. I hang out a lot on the r/emacs subreddit and have gotten tons of tips and troubleshooting help from there. r/planetemacs is also great — they focus mostly on packages and blog posts/article links.\nEmacs also has a pretty good documentation and help system. You can take the Emacs tutorial using C-h t. Ask Emacs for help using:\nC-h v to see the documentation for a variable C-h f to see the documentation for a function C-h k to see what a keybinding does C-h m to show help for the current major and minor modes Or read on the Emacs Wiki.\nConfig Inspo This brings me to my first and (I think) most helpful tip: Get inspired by other people’s configurations.\nI’ll talk a little later about the basics of using Elisp for your config file, and that might be useful to help you read and understand the configs, but I think it’s good to have a starting point and to start experimenting early.\nIf you’re only just starting out, I invite you to check out my config and send me any questions you might have by email. (If you’re experienced, I invite you to send me any corrections or improvements!)\nHere are some of the configurations I have stolen a lot of my configuration from and can heartily recommend checking out.\nLars Tveito Jake Boxerman, with accompanying video Protesilaos Stavrou David Wilson (System Crafters) Nicolas Rougier Check out the configs piece by piece by copying something into your own config and testing it out for a while. This is probably what has been the most helpful to me.\nYou could also get a lot of useful tips and tricks from checking out some curated, “sane defaults” builds of Emacs. These are designed to be minimal and extensible, just configuring some settings to make the initial switch to Emacs a little smoother and give you a solid foundation for writing your own config. Most of them don’t include too many extra packages, either. Some of these include:\nPrelude Crafted Emacs Purcell’s Emacs config Nano Emacs Basics: Setting Variables Your configuration file is an Emacs Lisp file called init.el, located in your Emacs home directory. Usually, this is at ~/.emacs.d/init.el. This is where you’ll add your code, and Emacs will load this file at startup.\nEmacs can be configured either by modifying default behaviour or by installing and configuring community packages. You’ll probably want to do both.\nThere are quite a few blog posts and configurations that cover how to set “sane defaults” — i.e., modify the default behaviour of Emacs in a way most people would agree with. Check out the “early init” files or startup sections of the configs above. You might also want to check out sensible-defaults, which contains a lot of useful and, yes, sensible functions you can use in your config.\nIn general, you set the value of a variable using setq. Specify the name of the variable or the mode, then set it to an accepted value. Often variables will use t / nil and modes will use 1 / 0.\n(setq enabled-option t disabled-option nil enabled-mode 1 disabled-mode 0) Installing Packages After you’re done tweaking Emacs’ default behaviours, you’ll probably need some packages.\nYou can install a package from a package source or load an installed package in your load path using the require keyword.\n(require 'package-name) This is the easiest way to get started. Add the require-line to your init.el file and use setq to configure the package.\nIn fact, at the top of your init.el file, you should (require 'package). package.el is the default package manager for Emacs.\nMany Emacs packages are available at MELPA, a package archive with generally high-quality packages. You might also want to add some other package sources. Here’s an example from my config, where I add quite a few sources and tell Emacs which places to check first.\n(setq package-archives '((\"GNU ELPA\" . \"https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/\") (\"MELPA\" . \"https://melpa.org/packages/\") (\"ORG\" . \"https://orgmode.org/elpa/\") (\"MELPA Stable\" . \"https://stable.melpa.org/packages/\") (\"nongnu\" . \"https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/\")) package-archive-priorities '((\"GNU ELPA\" . 20) (\"MELPA\" . 15) (\"ORG\" . 10) (\"MELPA Stable\" . 5) (\"nongnu\" . 0))) (package-initialize) After setting up your package sources, you can add (require 'package-name) to your init.el and Emacs will automatically search, download, and install that package from the source. Remember to evaluate your init.el file for this to happen, either by using the command eval-buffer on init.el or by restarting Emacs.\nSome packages are not available on MELPA \u0026 Co., in which case you might want to download it and save it on your computer manually. Or maybe you want to use a package you’ve written yourself.\nIn that case, you can also point Emacs to look for .el files on your computer. It’s practical to put all these files in the same place and add all of them to your “load path” so Emacs knows where to look for them. Here’s a setup for loading files from the ~/.emacs.d/local-lisp directory and sub-directories.\n(defvar local-lisp \"~/.emacs.d/local-lisp/\") (add-to-list 'load-path local-lisp) (let ((default-directory local-lisp)) (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path)) A note on package management\rUsing require and setting all your variables with setq statements can lead to a long and hard-to-read config when you add many packages.\nThat’s why some people prefer using other systems or wrappers around package.el, for example use-package, quelpa, or straight. You’ll see this a lot in the installation instructions for packages. Personally, I use use-package because it’s so prevalent and because it’s quite convenient.\nBut don’t get too caught up in this, you don’t need to use any of these, and it’s not very hard to refactor your code incrementally if you decide you want to try later.\nHere’s a (simple) example of how to remove some visual elements from vanilla Emacs:\n(setq tool-bar-mode 0 ;; Remove toolbar scroll-bar-mode 0 ;; Remove scollbars menu-bar-mode 0 ;; Remove menu bar blink-cursor-mode 0) ;; Solid cursor, not blinking And here’s an example of setting up the Olivetti package:\n(require 'olivetti) ;; Make sure Olivetti is installed (setq olivetti-style t) ;; Set the 'olivetti-style' variable to true Some Package Suggestions I still think you should use bits and pieces of other people’s configurations to figure out what look and feel you prefer for your Emacs experience, but below I have gathered some packages I like and some alternatives to them.\nCompletion Systems The really big one is your completion system. By default, some things in Emacs can feel a little clunky, such as entering commands, searching documents, and finding files. Thankfully, there are packages that give you a nice prompt with auto-completions, search tools, suggestions, prettification, etc. For example, they can auto-fill directory and file names when opening a file with C-x C-f.\nThese packages are usually combined with other supplementary packages, but there are a few common ones that people use as the core of their systems. They include:\nVertico Helm Ido As mentioned, there are many, many packages people pair with these systems. Ido comes built-in with Emacs, so you might want to start there. I personally use Vertico and have been very happy with that. I tried Helm, but found it a little overwhelming and felt I wasn’t using it to its full potential. People do love it though.\nPlay around with them a little, and if you like one, I’d say stick to it. Jumping around with these is kind of confusing, so I would only consider switching if I had a problem with the one I was using, or if another one had some very attractive feature.\nTerminal Emulators You can emulate a terminal inside Emacs. I.e., you never have to leave Emacs!\nThere’s a built-in terminal emulator, but it’s not particularly nice. Instead, I would suggest checking out either vterm or Eat.\nText Editing Some packages just make text editing easier.\nTake for example auto-completion packages such as the built-in dabbrev-mode, or corfu and company-mode.\nDepending on your use, you might find multiple-cursors useful.\nDe Facto Standards Magit is the best Git interface I’ve ever used.\nSpell- and syntax-checking is usually done with Flyspell and Flycheck, respectively. These are pretty great.\nHelpful gives you better help buffers.\nWhen you start a keybinding combination, which-key shows a popup with suggestions for possible continuations of the sequence.\nMore Packages For suggestions on more packages to check out, awesome-emacs is a curated and oft-updated package list. I also love browsing the top posts on the Emacs subreddits mentioned above.\nAesthetics: Fonts \u0026 Themes The quickest way to make your Emacs experience feel more personalised!\nThere are many different ways to set fonts in Emacs. You can also set different fonts for the Emacs UI, for programming (monospaced or “fixed pitch” fonts) and for prose editing (regular or “variable pitch” fonts).\nHere’s how I set my fonts. I use Roboto Mono for the UI and for programming, and I use Source Sans Pro for my other documents. I check that the relevant font is installed, and then set their size using the :height property.\n(when (member \"Roboto Mono\" (font-family-list)) (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font \"Roboto Mono\" :height 108) (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family \"Roboto Mono\")) (when (member \"Source Sans Pro\" (font-family-list)) (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family \"Source Sans Pro\" :height 1.18)) Note that I don’t set the height of the programming (fixed pitch) font. It simply uses the same height as the default font. I do set the size of the prose (variable pitch) font, though, and I do that by giving a relative size – it’s relative to the size of the default font.\nWhen it comes to themes, I’d recommend starting with a pack so you can explore many different options quickly, without needing to install a bunch of theme packages by hand. A great place to get started, is Doom Emacs’ theme pack called doom-themes. I particularly like the doom-nord theme. You can install and enable it like this:\n(require' doom-themes) ;; Make sure doom-themes are installed (load-theme 'doom-nord t) ;; Load the doom-nord theme I also really like the Modus themes, the Ef themes and the Nano themes. You can find many more on emacsthemes.com.\nProgramming Eglot (Emacs polyGLOT) is an LSP server client for Emacs that comes pre-installed from Emacs 29. You can install it manually in Emacs \u003e26.3.\nYou can also build Emacs with tree-sitter support. It’s available for Emacs \u003e25.1.\nBesides this, there are tons of major modes for various languages, usually called -mode. These will often give you basic syntax highlighting and commands.\nFor example, here’s a simple way to get basic Python 3.11 support:\n(require 'python-mode) (setq python-shell-interpreter \"python3.11\") Here’s my current setup for Haskell (except I’ve rewritten it to use require instead of use-package) using the Stack tool to build my Haskell projects:\n(require 'haskell-mode) (add-hook 'haskell-mode 'haskell-doc-mode) (setq haskell-hoogle-command \"hoogle\" haskell-compile-stack-build-command \"stack build\" haskell-compile-stack-build-alt-command \"stack build --pedantic\") (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd \"C-c h\") 'haskell-hoogle) (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd \"C-c C-c\") 'haskell-compile) Hooks In the Haskell example above, we briefly saw how to add a hook. A hook lets you run a function each time a specific thing happens. Most of the time, this is used to execute some function or activate/deactivate a mode when a certain mode is activated.\nFor example, in my Haskell config, I want to activate haskell-doc-mode each time I activate haskell-mode, so that I always have documentation on hand while I’m programming in Haskell.\nMaybe you want to activate line numbers each time you start programming. To do that, you can add a hook to prog-mode like so:\n;; Activate 'display-line-numbers-mode' when programming (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'display-line-numbers-mode) Note the apostrophe before the names of the functions (here, the names of the modes)!\nYou can do so many more things with hooks and get really creative! I mostly use them to set up my modes the way I like them. E.g., I always center my text buffers (Org mode, LaTeX, etc.) with Olivetti and I hide the line numbers.\nBinding Keys We can get pretty deep on the subject of keybindings, so I’ll try to keep it brief.\nMost major modes with have a dedicated “mode map” of all the keybindings you can use while in that mode. Remember that you can always check out the currently available keybindings with C-h m, which describes the current major and minor modes.\nThis separation is very useful, as it allows you to bind the same keys to similar commands in different settings. E.g., you can bind C-c C-c to the relevant compilation command in all your programming languages if you like, even if the actual compilation command is different for each. You can also define your own custom keymaps and dictate when they should be used (another thing you can use hooks for!)\nIn general, you can bind a key globally, locally, or in a specific keymap like so:\n(global-set-key KEY COMMAND) (local-set-key KEY COMMAND) (define-key KEYMAP KEY COMMAND) Note that the KEY must be given in a way Emacs understands. You can use the kbd macro and then provide your keystrokes as a string, e.g., (kbd \"C-c C-c\"). Navigation keys and the function keys must be surrounded by \u003c\u003e, e.g., and .\nAgain from the Haskell config, I set keybindings for haskell-compile and haskell-hoogle commands in the haskell-mode-map.\n(define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd \"C-c h\") 'haskell-hoogle) (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd \"C-c C-c\") 'haskell-compile) You can define keybindings for any command in Emacs. People even build personalised mnemonic systems. If you want to dive deep into keybindings, I would recommend checking out the package Hydra.\nConclusion Tinkering with my Emacs config is probably my favourite past-time, but even I will admit it was a bit of a headache in the very, very beginning. I hope this post has put a small dent in that frustration for you, or maybe given you some pointers to where you might want to take your WIP config.\nI welcome corrections, feedback, and questions by email. Happy hacking!\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> is a wonderful piece of software. It&rsquo;s easily my favourite program of all
time. It can also be a little overwhelming to configure for the first time.</p>
<p>One of the many things that make Emacs great, though, is its dedicated and
helpful user base. I hope to add a small contribution to that community with
this post, going over what I would have told my past self as I was just starting
out using Emacs and trying to write my first Emacs configuration file.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll assume you know the basics of editing with Emacs and won&rsquo;t cover general
concepts like major modes or how to save files in Emacs. I&rsquo;ll primarily be
focusing on how you can get started personalising it.</p>
<p>Before we get into it, I&rsquo;d like to cover three things: (1) Emacs is a Lisp
interpreter at heart, (2) there are great places to get help,
and (3) you should try out pieces of other people&rsquo;s configs.</p>
<h2 id="preamble">Preamble<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#preamble">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="a-primer-in-emacs-and-elisp">A Primer in Emacs and Elisp<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-primer-in-emacs-and-elisp">#</a></h3>
<p>Emacs is often thought of as a text editor. While it is built around text
editing and has many great packages to do so, I&rsquo;d argue it&rsquo;s more useful to
think of it as an (Emacs) Lisp interpreter.</p>
<p>Your configuration file is a program of Emacs Lisp (or &ldquo;elisp&rdquo; for short) code
that modifies the behaviour of Emacs itself. Most of the behaviours of vanilla
Emacs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp#:~:text=Emacs%20Lisp%20is%20a%20dialect,as%20is%20the%20Lisp%20interpreter.">written
in Elisp</a>, and the rest in C. Therefore, almost everything that Emacs does, you
can change! You can, of course, add and create new functionality as well.</p>
<p>The power to build your ideal editor is right at your fingertips! As long as
you&rsquo;re willing to learn a little bit of a Lisp dialect.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Elisp is a pretty readable language and as long as you watch your
parentheses, you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<h3 id="get-help">Get Help<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#get-help">#</a></h3>
<p>The Emacs community is very friendly and are often keep to help
out. I hang out a lot on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/">r/emacs
subreddit</a> and have gotten tons of tips and troubleshooting help from there.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/planetemacs">r/planetemacs</a> is also great &mdash; they focus mostly on packages and blog posts/article links.</p>
<p>Emacs also has a pretty good documentation and help system. You can take the
Emacs tutorial using <code>C-h t</code>. Ask Emacs for help using:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C-h v</code> to see the documentation for a variable</li>
<li><code>C-h f</code> to see the documentation for a function</li>
<li><code>C-h k</code> to see what a keybinding does</li>
<li><code>C-h m</code> to show help for the current major and minor modes</li>
</ul>
<p>Or read on the <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/">Emacs Wiki</a>.</p>
<h3 id="config-inspo">Config Inspo<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#config-inspo">#</a></h3>
<p>This brings me to my first and (I think) most helpful tip: Get inspired by other
people&rsquo;s configurations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk a little later about the basics of using Elisp for your config file,
and that might be useful to help you read and understand the configs, but I
think it&rsquo;s good to have a starting point and to start experimenting early.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re only just starting out, I invite you to check out <a href="https://github.com/SophieBosio/.emacs.d">my config</a> and send
me any questions you might have by <a href="mailto:sophie.bosio@outlook.com">email</a>. (If you&rsquo;re experienced, I invite you to send me
any corrections or improvements!)</p>
<p>Here are some of the configurations I have stolen a lot of my configuration from and
can heartily recommend checking out.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/larstvei/dot-emacs">Lars Tveito</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jakebox/jake-emacs">Jake Boxerman</a>, with <a href="https://youtu.be/Gi7yBMYZylU?si=OO0r57KvYpUL2S9W">accompanying video</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/dotfiles">Protesilaos Stavrou</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles">David Wilson (System Crafters)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rougier/dotemacs">Nicolas Rougier</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the configs piece by piece by copying something into your own config
and testing it out for a while. This is probably what has been the most helpful
to me.</p>
<p>You could also get a lot of useful tips and tricks from checking out some
curated, &ldquo;sane defaults&rdquo; builds of Emacs. These are designed to be minimal and
extensible, just configuring some settings to make the initial switch to Emacs a
little smoother and give you a solid foundation for writing your own config.
Most of them don&rsquo;t include too many extra packages, either.
Some of these include:</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs">Crafted Emacs</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="basics-setting-variables">Basics: Setting Variables<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#basics-setting-variables">#</a></h2>
<p>Your configuration file is an Emacs Lisp file called <code>init.el</code>, located in your
Emacs home directory. Usually, this is at <code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code>. This is where
you&rsquo;ll add your code, and Emacs will load this file at startup.</p>
<p>Emacs can be configured either by modifying default behaviour or by installing
and configuring community packages. You&rsquo;ll probably want to do both.</p>
<p>There are quite a few blog posts and configurations that cover how to set &ldquo;sane
defaults&rdquo; &mdash; i.e., modify the default behaviour of Emacs in a way most people
would agree with. Check out the &ldquo;early init&rdquo; files or startup sections of the
configs above. You might also want to check out <a href="https://github.com/hrs/sensible-defaults.el">sensible-defaults</a>, which
contains a lot of useful and, yes, sensible functions you can use in your config.</p>
<p>In general, you set the value of a variable using <code>setq</code>. Specify the name of the
variable or the mode, then set it to an accepted value. Often variables will use
<code>t</code> / <code>nil</code> and modes will use <code>1</code> / <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>After you&rsquo;re done tweaking Emacs&rsquo; default behaviours, you&rsquo;ll probably need some
packages.</p>
<p>You can install a package from a package source or load an installed package in
your load path using the <code>require</code> keyword.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="ss">&#39;package-name</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is the easiest way to get started. Add the <code>require</code>-line to your <code>init.el</code>
file and use <code>setq</code> to configure the package.</p>
<p>In fact, at the top of your <code>init.el</code> file, you should <code>(require 'package)</code>.
<code>package.el</code> is the default package manager for Emacs.</p>
<p>Many Emacs packages are
available at <a href="https://melpa.org/">MELPA</a>, a package archive with generally high-quality packages. You
might also want to add some other package sources. Here&rsquo;s an example from my
config, where I add quite a few sources and tell Emacs which places to check
first.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After setting up your package sources, you can add <code>(require 'package-name)</code> to
your <code>init.el</code> and Emacs will automatically search, download, and install that
package from the source. Remember to evaluate your <code>init.el</code> file for this to happen,
either by using the command <code>eval-buffer</code> on <code>init.el</code> or by restarting Emacs.</p>
<p>Some packages are not available on MELPA &amp; Co., in which case you might want to
download it and save it on your computer manually. Or maybe you want to use a
package you&rsquo;ve written yourself.</p>
<p>In that case, you can also point Emacs to look for <code>.el</code> files on your computer.
It&rsquo;s practical to put all these files in the same place and add all of them to
your &ldquo;load path&rdquo; so Emacs knows where to look for them. Here&rsquo;s a setup for
loading files from the  <code>~/.emacs.d/local-lisp</code> directory and sub-directories.</p>

<summary>A note on package management</summary>
<div class="details">
<p>Using <code>require</code> and setting all your variables with <code>setq</code> statements can lead to a
long and hard-to-read config when you add many packages.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why some people prefer using other systems or wrappers around <code>package.el</code>,
for example <code>use-package</code>, <code>quelpa</code>, or <code>straight</code>. You&rsquo;ll see this a lot in the
installation instructions for packages. Personally, I use <code>use-package</code> because it&rsquo;s so
prevalent and because it&rsquo;s quite convenient.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t get too caught up in this, you don&rsquo;t
<em>need</em> to use any of these, and it&rsquo;s not very hard to refactor your code incrementally if you
decide you want to try later.</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a (simple) example of how to remove some visual elements from vanilla Emacs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">setq</span> <span class="nv">tool-bar-mode</span>     <span class="mi">0</span>    <span class="c1">;; Remove toolbar</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="some-package-suggestions">Some Package Suggestions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#some-package-suggestions">#</a></h2>
<p>I still think you should use bits and pieces of other people&rsquo;s configurations to
figure out what look and feel you prefer for your Emacs experience, but below I
have gathered some packages I like and some alternatives to them.</p>
<h3 id="completion-systems">Completion Systems<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#completion-systems">#</a></h3>
<p>The really big one is your <strong>completion system</strong>. By default, some things in Emacs
can feel a little clunky, such as entering commands, searching documents, and
finding files. Thankfully, there are packages that give you a nice prompt with auto-completions,
search tools, suggestions, prettification, etc. For example, they can auto-fill
directory and file names when opening a file with <code>C-x C-f</code>.</p>
<p>These packages are usually combined with other supplementary packages, but
there are a few common ones that people use as the core of their systems.
They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/minad/vertico">Vertico</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">Helm</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ido.html">Ido</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned, there are many, <em>many</em> packages people pair with these systems. Ido
comes built-in with Emacs, so you might want to start there. I personally use
Vertico and have been very happy with that. I tried Helm, but found it a little
overwhelming and felt I wasn&rsquo;t using it to its full potential. People do love it
though.</p>
<p>Play around with them a little, and if you like one, I&rsquo;d say stick to
it. Jumping around with these is kind of confusing, so I would only consider
switching if I had a problem with the one I was using, or if another one had

<p>The quickest way to make your Emacs experience feel more personalised!</p>
<p>There are many different ways to set fonts in Emacs. You can also set different
fonts for the Emacs UI, for programming (monospaced or &ldquo;fixed pitch&rdquo; fonts) and
for prose editing (regular or &ldquo;variable pitch&rdquo; fonts).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how I set my fonts. I use Roboto Mono for the UI and for programming, and
I use Source Sans Pro for my other documents. I check that the relevant font is
installed, and then set their size using the <code>:height</code> property.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">when</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">member</span> <span class="s">&#34;Roboto Mono&#34;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">font-family-list</span><span class="p">))</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that I don&rsquo;t set the height of the programming (fixed pitch) font. It
simply uses the same height as the default font. I do set the size of the prose
(variable pitch) font, though, and I do that by giving a <em>relative</em> size &ndash; it&rsquo;s
relative to the size of the default font.</p>
<p>When it comes to themes, I&rsquo;d recommend starting with a pack so you can explore
many different options quickly, without needing to install a bunch of theme
packages by hand. A great place to get started, is Doom Emacs&rsquo; theme pack called
<a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/themes">doom-themes</a>. I particularly like the <code>doom-nord</code> theme. You can install and enable
it like this:</p>

<h2 id="programming">Programming<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#programming">#</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot">Eglot</a> (Emacs polyGLOT) is an LSP server client for Emacs that comes pre-installed from Emacs 29.
You can install it manually in Emacs &gt;26.3.</p>
<p>You can also build Emacs with
<a href="https://emacs-tree-sitter.github.io/">tree-sitter</a> support. It&rsquo;s available for Emacs &gt;25.1.</p>
<p>Besides this, there are tons of major modes for various languages, usually
called <code>&lt;language-name&gt;-mode</code>. These will often give you basic syntax highlighting
and commands.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s a
simple way to get basic Python 3.11 support:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="ss">&#39;python-mode</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="hooks">Hooks<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#hooks">#</a></h2>
<p>In the Haskell example above, we briefly saw how to add a hook. A hook lets you
run a function each time a specific thing happens. Most of the time, this is
used to execute some function or activate/deactivate a mode when a certain mode
is activated.</p>
<p>For example, in my Haskell config, I want to activate <code>haskell-doc-mode</code> each time
I activate <code>haskell-mode</code>, so that I always have documentation on hand while I&rsquo;m
programming in Haskell.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to activate line numbers each time you start programming. To do
that, you can add a hook to <code>prog-mode</code> like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">;; Activate &#39;display-line-numbers-mode&#39; when programming</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add-hook</span> <span class="ss">&#39;prog-mode-hook</span> <span class="ss">&#39;display-line-numbers-mode</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note the apostrophe before the names of the functions (here, the names of the modes)!</p>
<p>You can do so many more things with hooks and get really creative! I mostly use
them to set up my modes the way I like them. E.g., I always center my text
buffers (Org mode, LaTeX, etc.) with Olivetti and I hide the line numbers.</p>
<h2 id="binding-keys">Binding Keys<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#binding-keys">#</a></h2>
<p>We can get pretty deep on the subject of keybindings, so I&rsquo;ll try to keep it
brief.</p>
<p>Most major modes with have a dedicated &ldquo;mode map&rdquo; of all the keybindings you can
use while in that mode. Remember that you can always check out the currently
available keybindings with <code>C-h m</code>, which describes the current major and minor
modes.</p>
<p>This separation is very useful, as it allows you to bind the same keys to
similar commands in different settings. E.g., you can bind <code>C-c C-c</code> to the
relevant compilation command in all your programming languages if you like, even
if the actual compilation command is different for each. You can also define
your own custom keymaps and dictate when they should be used (another thing you
can use hooks for!)</p>
<p>In general, you can bind a key globally, locally, or in a specific keymap like
so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">global-set-key</span> <span class="nv">KEY</span> <span class="nv">COMMAND</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">local-set-key</span>  <span class="nv">KEY</span> <span class="nv">COMMAND</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">define-key</span>     <span class="nv">KEYMAP</span> <span class="nv">KEY</span> <span class="nv">COMMAND</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note that the <code>KEY</code> must be given in a way Emacs understands. You can use the
<code>kbd</code> macro and then provide your keystrokes as a string, e.g., <code>(kbd &quot;C-c C-c&quot;)</code>.
Navigation keys and the function keys must be surrounded by <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, e.g., <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;F1&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Again from the Haskell config, I set keybindings for <code>haskell-compile</code> and
<code>haskell-hoogle</code> commands in the <code>haskell-mode-map</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">define-key</span> <span class="nv">haskell-mode-map</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">kbd</span> <span class="s">&#34;C-c h&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span>   <span class="ss">&#39;haskell-hoogle</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">define-key</span> <span class="nv">haskell-mode-map</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">kbd</span> <span class="s">&#34;C-c C-c&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="ss">&#39;haskell-compile</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can define keybindings for any command in Emacs. People even build
personalised mnemonic systems. If you want to dive deep into keybindings, I
would recommend checking out the package <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra">Hydra</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Tinkering with my Emacs config is probably my favourite past-time, but even I
will admit it was a bit of a headache in the very, very beginning. I hope this
post has put a small dent in that frustration for you, or maybe given you some
pointers to where you might want to take your WIP config.</p>
