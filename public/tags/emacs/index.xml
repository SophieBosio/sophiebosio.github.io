      <description>In my opinion, the power of Emacs is that you&amp;rsquo;re able to program your own working environment. Other editors may be just as, or possibly more, efficient to use, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t come across any that give you control over as many aspects of your editor as Emacs does. Customising and tweaking your configuration may be an endless endeavour, but it&amp;rsquo;s also a highly rewarding one.
All that being said, I was inspired to tweak the look of my Org Mode setup, especially after reading this post.</description>

      <description>This website is built with Hugo and ox-hugo, an exporting engine that lets me write my posts in Org mode and then put it online easily.
Org mode is a really clever and powerful plain text format that works great for note taking, text editing, and TODO lists/agendas. Moreover, there are a lot of convenient features for us Emacs users when using ox-hugo to write our blogs (besides staying in the comfort of a well-known format and editing flow).</description>
