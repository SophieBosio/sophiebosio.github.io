[{"content":"I use Clojure on the backend where I work. I think it\u0026rsquo;s really fun, especially in combination with Emacs, since Emacs is built with Emacs Lisp and Clojure is a Lisp dialect. So many of Emacs\u0026rsquo; default keybindings started clicking for me once I started working with a language in the same tradition, editing structurally and by semantic units rather than line-by-line or character-by-character. I\u0026rsquo;m not alone in loving both and there\u0026rsquo;s clearly a lot of overlap between the two communities, which is evident from the number of Clojure packages for Emacs.\nThe probably most famous and popular among these is the excellent package CIDER, which provides a full-fledged development environment for Emacs with support for interactive development. CIDER has a ton of features for evaluating, debugging, and testing your code. However, you might want to supplement CIDER with other packages for things such as peeking function argument lists, navigating your code, and finding references/implementations. Emacs has some built-in documentation (eldoc), project management (project) and reference-finding capabilities (xref). But when you need more, clojure-lsp is your friend and the LSP client for Emacs lsp-mode integrates pretty well with the aforementioned built-ins.\nBasic Setup With clojure-lsp installed, you can use your preferred package manager to get the Emacs package lsp-mode. I use use-package. lsp-mode is pretty good at integrating with the built-in Emacs features, so I\u0026rsquo;ll let it autoconfigure, which it does by default. I\u0026rsquo;ll defer the package loading to shave off some precious milliseconds at Emacs\u0026rsquo; startup.\n(use-package lsp-mode :defer t) Let\u0026rsquo;s add some hooks to start up lsp-mode when I\u0026rsquo;m programming in Clojure. I\u0026rsquo;ll also enable the which-key integration.\n(use-package lsp-mode :defer t :hook ((clojure-mode . lsp) (clojurec-mode . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration))) Custom Bindings Next, I\u0026rsquo;ll bind some keys. The LSP server can suggest code actions and to execute these quickly, I\u0026rsquo;ll bind the command lsp-execute-code-action to M-\u0026lt;return\u0026gt;. xref works pretty well in Clojure and lets you jump to the definition of a symbol with M-. (and jump back by popping the ref off the stack with M-,), so to find references instead of the implementation, I\u0026rsquo;ll bind lsp-find-references to C-M-..\n(use-package lsp-mode :defer t :hook ((clojure-mode . lsp) (clojurec-mode . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :bind (:map lsp-mode-map (\u0026#34;C-M-.\u0026#34; . lsp-find-references) (\u0026#34;C-c r\u0026#34; . lsp-rename) (\u0026#34;M-\u0026lt;return\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . lsp-execute-code-action))) Then, C-M-. pops up an xref buffer where I can see all references to a function, in which I can select an entry and jump to the call site.\nI can also press C-c r to rename a symbol as you\u0026rsquo;d expect.\nM-\u0026lt;return\u0026gt; gives me a minibuffer with available code actions.\nAs a quick note, the code actions show up in a regular minibuffer. I just use vertico with vertico-posframe, which gives me a nice childframe for mine.\nIn case you\u0026rsquo;re interested, you can get rounded corners (on Mac OS) and fringes (Mac OS \u0026amp; Linux) by setting the variable vertico-posframe-paramters with the following settings:\n(setq vertico-posframe-parameters \u0026#39;((left-fringe . 12) (right-fringe . 12) (undecorated . nil))) Diagnostics LSP mode automatically tries to figure out which diagnostics tool you\u0026rsquo;re using, but I ran into some strange problem with the :auto setting when using Flycheck, so I set it to use Flycheck manually.\n(use-package lsp-mode :defer t :hook ((clojure-mode . lsp) (clojurec-mode . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :bind (:map lsp-mode-map (\u0026#34;C-M-.\u0026#34; . lsp-find-references) (\u0026#34;C-c r\u0026#34; . lsp-rename) (\u0026#34;M-\u0026lt;return\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . lsp-execute-code-action)) :config (setq lsp-diagnostics-provider :flycheck)) This gives me the regular Flycheck indicators (the arrows) that something\u0026rsquo;s wrong, but also information in the echo area and in a popup childframe on mouse hover.\nCustomisation From this point onwards, the LSP server works really well on my machine for Clojure. However, lsp-mode comes with a few more bells and whistles than I\u0026rsquo;d like, so I\u0026rsquo;ll finish by deactivating some features. A tour of on-by-default features and guide on how to disable them can be found here.\n(use-package lsp-mode :defer t :hook ((clojure-mode . lsp) (clojurec-mode . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :bind (:map lsp-mode-map (\u0026#34;C-M-.\u0026#34; . lsp-find-references) (\u0026#34;C-c r\u0026#34; . lsp-rename) (\u0026#34;M-\u0026lt;return\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . lsp-execute-code-action)) :config (setq lsp-diagnostics-provider :flycheck) ;; Disable visual features (setq lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable nil ;; No breadcrumbs lsp-ui-sideline-enable nil ;; No sideline lsp-lens-enable nil ;; No lenses ;; Disable all mode line features, since I use a custom mode line lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable nil lsp-modeline-diagnostics-enable nil ;; Limit raising of the echo area to show docs lsp-signature-doc-lines 3)) With all this, I get a lot of nice LSP features. In conjunction with CIDER, this is starting to feel really smooth.\nFor example, the function\u0026rsquo;s docstring in the echo area when it\u0026rsquo;s at point.\nLSP-mode also plays nicely with my completion system, here using corfu.\nPerformance Improvements And finally, LSP-mode works a little bit faster if we set it to use plists for serialisation. We can set this in the :init-block of the use-package declaration.\n:init (setq lsp-use-plists t) Note that if you want to do this, you also need to add (setenv \u0026quot;LSP_USE_PLISTS\u0026quot; \u0026quot;true\u0026quot;) to your early-init.el. See the performance part of the lsp-mode documentation for more information.\nFinal Configuration \u0026amp; Further Reading And here\u0026rsquo;s the final configuration that I\u0026rsquo;m using for Clojure as of September 2024.\n(use-package lsp-mode :defer t :init (setq lsp-use-plists t) :hook ((clojure-mode . lsp) (clojurec-mode . lsp) (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration)) :bind (:map lsp-mode-map (\u0026#34;C-M-.\u0026#34; . lsp-find-references) (\u0026#34;C-c r\u0026#34; . lsp-rename) (\u0026#34;M-\u0026lt;return\u0026gt;\u0026#34; . lsp-execute-code-action)) :config (setq lsp-diagnostics-provider :flycheck) ;; Disable visual features (setq lsp-headerline-breadcrumb-enable nil ;; No breadcrumbs lsp-ui-sideline-enable nil ;; No sideline lsp-lens-enable nil ;; No lenses ;; Disable all mode line features, since I use a custom mode line lsp-modeline-code-actions-enable nil lsp-modeline-diagnostics-enable nil ;; Limit raising of the echo area to show docs lsp-signature-doc-lines 3)) The next thing I would consider to enhance my Clojure coding experience even further, is incorporating structural editing. Clojure, being a LISP dialect and therefore pretty close to an abstract syntax tree, is especially well-suited to structural editing. paredit is the classic and what I\u0026rsquo;ve used previously. Now, I use a combination of paredit and lispy, which has many more functions than paredit, with paredit-style keybindings. Smartparens is a paredit-alternative. puni is the most language-agnostic alternative, as far as I can tell.\nThanks for reading! I welcome feedback, comments, or questions.

It\u0026rsquo;s easily my favourite program of all time. It can also be a little overwhelming to configure for the first time.\nOne of the many things that make Emacs great, though, is its dedicated and helpful user base. I hope to add a small contribution to that community with this post, going over what I would have told my past self as I was just starting out using Emacs and trying to write my first Emacs configuration file.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll assume you know the basics of editing with Emacs and won\u0026rsquo;t cover general concepts like major modes or how to save files in Emacs. I\u0026rsquo;ll primarily be focusing on how you can get started personalising it.\nBefore we get into it, I\u0026rsquo;d like to cover three things: (1) Emacs is a Lisp interpreter at heart, (2) there are great places to get help, and (3) you should try out pieces of other people\u0026rsquo;s configs.\nPreamble A Primer in Emacs and Elisp Emacs is often thought of as a text editor. While it is built around text editing and has many great packages to do so, I\u0026rsquo;d argue it\u0026rsquo;s more useful to think of it as an (Emacs) Lisp interpreter.\nYour configuration file is a program of Emacs Lisp (or \u0026ldquo;elisp\u0026rdquo; for short) code that modifies the behaviour of Emacs itself. Most of the behaviours of vanilla Emacs are written in Elisp, and the rest in C. Therefore, almost everything that Emacs does, you can change! You can, of course, add and create new functionality as well.\nThe power to build your ideal editor is right at your fingertips! As long as you\u0026rsquo;re willing to learn a little bit of a Lisp dialect.\nThankfully, Elisp is a pretty readable language and as long as you watch your parentheses, you\u0026rsquo;ll be fine.\nGet Help The Emacs community is very friendly and are often keep to help out. I hang out a lot on the r/emacs subreddit and have gotten tons of tips and troubleshooting help from there. r/planetemacs is also great \u0026mdash; they focus mostly on packages and blog posts/article links.\nEmacs also has a pretty good documentation and help system. You can take the Emacs tutorial using C-h t. Ask Emacs for help using:\nC-h v to see the documentation for a variable C-h f to see the documentation for a function C-h k to see what a keybinding does C-h m to show help for the current major and minor modes Or read on the Emacs Wiki.\nConfig Inspo This brings me to my first and (I think) most helpful tip: Get inspired by other people\u0026rsquo;s configurations.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll talk a little later about the basics of using Elisp for your config file, and that might be useful to help you read and understand the configs, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s good to have a starting point and to start experimenting early.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re only just starting out, I invite you to check out my config and send me any questions you might have by email. (If you\u0026rsquo;re experienced, I invite you to send me any corrections or improvements!)\nHere are some of the configurations I have stolen a lot of my configuration from and can heartily recommend checking out.\nLars Tveito Jake Boxerman, with accompanying video Protesilaos Stavrou David Wilson (System Crafters) Nicolas Rougier Check out the configs piece by piece by copying something into your own config and testing it out for a while. This is probably what has been the most helpful to me.\nYou could also get a lot of useful tips and tricks from checking out some curated, \u0026ldquo;sane defaults\u0026rdquo; builds of Emacs. These are designed to be minimal and extensible, just configuring some settings to make the initial switch to Emacs a little smoother and give you a solid foundation for writing your own config. Most of them don\u0026rsquo;t include too many extra packages, either. Some of these include:\nPrelude Crafted Emacs Purcell\u0026rsquo;s Emacs config Nano Emacs Basics: Setting Variables Your configuration file is an Emacs Lisp file called init.el, located in your Emacs home directory. Usually, this is at ~/.emacs.d/init.el. This is where you\u0026rsquo;ll add your code, and Emacs will load this file at startup.\nEmacs can be configured either by modifying default behaviour or by installing and configuring community packages. You\u0026rsquo;ll probably want to do both.\nThere are quite a few blog posts and configurations that cover how to set \u0026ldquo;sane defaults\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; i.e., modify the default behaviour of Emacs in a way most people would agree with. Check out the \u0026ldquo;early init\u0026rdquo; files or startup sections of the configs above. You might also want to check out sensible-defaults, which contains a lot of useful and, yes, sensible functions you can use in your config.\nIn general, you set the value of a variable using setq. Specify the name of the variable or the mode, then set it to an accepted value. Often variables will use t / nil and modes will use 1 / 0.\n(setq enabled-option t disabled-option nil enabled-mode 1 disabled-mode 0) Installing Packages After you\u0026rsquo;re done tweaking Emacs\u0026rsquo; default behaviours, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably need some packages.\nYou can install a package from a package source or load an installed package in your load path using the require keyword.\n(require \u0026#39;package-name) This is the easiest way to get started. Add the require-line to your init.el file and use setq to configure the package.\nIn fact, at the top of your init.el file, you should (require 'package). package.el is the default package manager for Emacs.\nMany Emacs packages are available at MELPA, a package archive with generally high-quality packages. You might also want to add some other package sources. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example from my config, where I add quite a few sources and tell Emacs which places to check first.\n(setq package-archives \u0026#39;((\u0026#34;GNU ELPA\u0026#34; . \u0026#34;https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/\u0026#34;) (\u0026#34;MELPA\u0026#34; . \u0026#34;https://melpa.org/packages/\u0026#34;) (\u0026#34;ORG\u0026#34; . \u0026#34;https://orgmode.org/elpa/\u0026#34;) (\u0026#34;MELPA Stable\u0026#34; . \u0026#34;https://stable.melpa.org/packages/\u0026#34;) (\u0026#34;nongnu\u0026#34; . \u0026#34;https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/\u0026#34;)) package-archive-priorities \u0026#39;((\u0026#34;GNU ELPA\u0026#34; . 20) (\u0026#34;MELPA\u0026#34; . 15) (\u0026#34;ORG\u0026#34; . 10) (\u0026#34;MELPA Stable\u0026#34; . 5) (\u0026#34;nongnu\u0026#34; . 0))) (package-initialize) After setting up your package sources, you can add (require 'package-name) to your init.el and Emacs will automatically search, download, and install that package from the source. Remember to evaluate your init.el file for this to happen, either by using the command eval-buffer on init.el or by restarting Emacs.\nSome packages are not available on MELPA \u0026amp; Co., in which case you might want to download it and save it on your computer manually. Or maybe you want to use a package you\u0026rsquo;ve written yourself.\nIn that case, you can also point Emacs to look for .el files on your computer. It\u0026rsquo;s practical to put all these files in the same place and add all of them to your \u0026ldquo;load path\u0026rdquo; so Emacs knows where to look for them. Here\u0026rsquo;s a setup for loading files from the ~/.emacs.d/local-lisp directory and sub-directories.\n(defvar local-lisp \u0026#34;~/.emacs.d/local-lisp/\u0026#34;) (add-to-list \u0026#39;load-path local-lisp) (let ((default-directory local-lisp)) (normal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path)) A note on package management\rUsing require and setting all your variables with setq statements can lead to a long and hard-to-read config when you add many packages.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why some people prefer using other systems or wrappers around package.el, for example use-package, quelpa, or straight. You\u0026rsquo;ll see this a lot in the installation instructions for packages. Personally, I use use-package because it\u0026rsquo;s so prevalent and because it\u0026rsquo;s quite convenient.\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t get too caught up in this, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to use any of these, and it\u0026rsquo;s not very hard to refactor your code incrementally if you decide you want to try later.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a (simple) example of how to remove some visual elements from vanilla Emacs:\n(setq tool-bar-mode 0 ;; Remove toolbar scroll-bar-mode 0 ;; Remove scollbars menu-bar-mode 0 ;; Remove menu bar blink-cursor-mode 0) ;; Solid cursor, not blinking And here\u0026rsquo;s an example of setting up the Olivetti package:\n(require \u0026#39;olivetti) ;; Make sure Olivetti is installed (setq olivetti-style t) ;; Set the \u0026#39;olivetti-style\u0026#39; variable to true Some Package Suggestions I still think you should use bits and pieces of other people\u0026rsquo;s configurations to figure out what look and feel you prefer for your Emacs experience, but below I have gathered some packages I like and some alternatives to them.\nCompletion Systems The really big one is your completion system. By default, some things in Emacs can feel a little clunky, such as entering commands, searching documents, and finding files. Thankfully, there are packages that give you a nice prompt with auto-completions, search tools, suggestions, prettification, etc. For example, they can auto-fill directory and file names when opening a file with C-x C-f.\nThese packages are usually combined with other supplementary packages, but there are a few common ones that people use as the core of their systems. They include:\nVertico Helm Ido As mentioned, there are many, many packages people pair with these systems. Ido comes built-in with Emacs, so you might want to start there. I personally use Vertico and have been very happy with that. I tried Helm, but found it a little overwhelming and felt I wasn\u0026rsquo;t using it to its full potential. People do love it though.\nPlay around with them a little, and if you like one, I\u0026rsquo;d say stick to it. Jumping around with these is kind of confusing, so I would only consider switching if I had a problem with the one I was using, or if another one had some very attractive feature.\nTerminal Emulators You can emulate a terminal inside Emacs. I.e., you never have to leave Emacs!\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a built-in terminal emulator, but it\u0026rsquo;s not particularly nice. Instead, I would suggest checking out either vterm or Eat.\nText Editing Some packages just make text editing easier.\nTake for example auto-completion packages such as the built-in dabbrev-mode, or corfu and company-mode.\nDepending on your use, you might find multiple-cursors useful.\nDe Facto Standards Magit is the best Git interface I\u0026rsquo;ve ever used.\nSpell- and syntax-checking is usually done with Flyspell and Flycheck, respectively. These are pretty great.\nHelpful gives you better help buffers.\nWhen you start a keybinding combination, which-key shows a popup with suggestions for possible continuations of the sequence.\nMore Packages For suggestions on more packages to check out, awesome-emacs is a curated and oft-updated package list. I also love browsing the top posts on the Emacs subreddits mentioned above.\nAesthetics: Fonts \u0026amp; Themes The quickest way to make your Emacs experience feel more personalised!\nThere are many different ways to set fonts in Emacs. You can also set different fonts for the Emacs UI, for programming (monospaced or \u0026ldquo;fixed pitch\u0026rdquo; fonts) and for prose editing (regular or \u0026ldquo;variable pitch\u0026rdquo; fonts).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how I set my fonts. I use Roboto Mono for the UI and for programming, and I use Source Sans Pro for my other documents. I check that the relevant font is installed, and then set their size using the :height property.\n(when (member \u0026#34;Roboto Mono\u0026#34; (font-family-list)) (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;default nil :font \u0026#34;Roboto Mono\u0026#34; :height 108) (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;fixed-pitch nil :family \u0026#34;Roboto Mono\u0026#34;)) (when (member \u0026#34;Source Sans Pro\u0026#34; (font-family-list)) (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;variable-pitch nil :family \u0026#34;Source Sans Pro\u0026#34; :height 1.18)) Note that I don\u0026rsquo;t set the height of the programming (fixed pitch) font. It simply uses the same height as the default font. I do set the size of the prose (variable pitch) font, though, and I do that by giving a relative size \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s relative to the size of the default font.\nWhen it comes to themes, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend starting with a pack so you can explore many different options quickly, without needing to install a bunch of theme packages by hand. A great place to get started, is Doom Emacs\u0026rsquo; theme pack called doom-themes. I particularly like the doom-nord theme. You can install and enable it like this:\n(require\u0026#39; doom-themes) ;; Make sure doom-themes are installed (load-theme \u0026#39;doom-nord t) ;; Load the doom-nord theme I also really like the Modus themes, the Ef themes and the Nano themes. You can find many more on emacsthemes.com.\nProgramming Eglot (Emacs polyGLOT) is an LSP server client for Emacs that comes pre-installed from Emacs 29. You can install it manually in Emacs \u0026gt;26.3.\nYou can also build Emacs with tree-sitter support. It\u0026rsquo;s available for Emacs \u0026gt;25.1.\nBesides this, there are tons of major modes for various languages, usually called \u0026lt;language-name\u0026gt;-mode. These will often give you basic syntax highlighting and commands.\nFor example, here\u0026rsquo;s a simple way to get basic Python 3.11 support:\n(require \u0026#39;python-mode) (setq python-shell-interpreter \u0026#34;python3.11\u0026#34;) Here\u0026rsquo;s my current setup for Haskell (except I\u0026rsquo;ve rewritten it to use require instead of use-package) using the Stack tool to build my Haskell projects:\n(require \u0026#39;haskell-mode) (add-hook \u0026#39;haskell-mode \u0026#39;haskell-doc-mode) (setq haskell-hoogle-command \u0026#34;hoogle\u0026#34; haskell-compile-stack-build-command \u0026#34;stack build\u0026#34; haskell-compile-stack-build-alt-command \u0026#34;stack build --pedantic\u0026#34;) (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd \u0026#34;C-c h\u0026#34;) \u0026#39;haskell-hoogle) (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd \u0026#34;C-c C-c\u0026#34;) \u0026#39;haskell-compile) Hooks In the Haskell example above, we briefly saw how to add a hook. A hook lets you run a function each time a specific thing happens. Most of the time, this is used to execute some function or activate/deactivate a mode when a certain mode is activated.\nFor example, in my Haskell config, I want to activate haskell-doc-mode each time I activate haskell-mode, so that I always have documentation on hand while I\u0026rsquo;m programming in Haskell.\nMaybe you want to activate line numbers each time you start programming. To do that, you can add a hook to prog-mode like so:\n;; Activate \u0026#39;display-line-numbers-mode\u0026#39; when programming (add-hook \u0026#39;prog-mode-hook \u0026#39;display-line-numbers-mode) Note the apostrophe before the names of the functions (here, the names of the modes)!\nYou can do so many more things with hooks and get really creative! I mostly use them to set up my modes the way I like them. E.g., I always center my text buffers (Org mode, LaTeX, etc.) with Olivetti and I hide the line numbers.\nBinding Keys We can get pretty deep on the subject of keybindings, so I\u0026rsquo;ll try to keep it brief.\nMost major modes with have a dedicated \u0026ldquo;mode map\u0026rdquo; of all the keybindings you can use while in that mode. Remember that you can always check out the currently available keybindings with C-h m, which describes the current major and minor modes.\nThis separation is very useful, as it allows you to bind the same keys to similar commands in different settings. E.g., you can bind C-c C-c to the relevant compilation command in all your programming languages if you like, even if the actual compilation command is different for each. You can also define your own custom keymaps and dictate when they should be used (another thing you can use hooks for!)\nIn general, you can bind a key globally, locally, or in a specific keymap like so:\n(global-set-key KEY COMMAND) (local-set-key KEY COMMAND) (define-key KEYMAP KEY COMMAND) Note that the KEY must be given in a way Emacs understands. You can use the kbd macro and then provide your keystrokes as a string, e.g., (kbd \u0026quot;C-c C-c\u0026quot;). Navigation keys and the function keys must be surrounded by \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, e.g., \u0026lt;tab\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;F1\u0026gt;.\nAgain from the Haskell config, I set keybindings for haskell-compile and haskell-hoogle commands in the haskell-mode-map.\n(define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd \u0026#34;C-c h\u0026#34;) \u0026#39;haskell-hoogle) (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd \u0026#34;C-c C-c\u0026#34;) \u0026#39;haskell-compile) You can define keybindings for any command in Emacs. People even build personalised mnemonic systems. If you want to dive deep into keybindings, I would recommend checking out the package Hydra.\nConclusion Tinkering with my Emacs config is probably my favourite past-time, but even I will admit it was a bit of a headache in the very, very beginning. I hope this post has put a small dent in that frustration for you, or maybe given you some pointers to where you might want to take your WIP config.\nI welcome corrections, feedback, and questions by email. Happy hacking!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/first-emacs-config/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\"\u003eEmacs\u003c/a\u003e is a wonderful piece of software. It\u0026rsquo;s easily my favourite program of all\ntime. It can also be a little overwhelming to configure for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the many things that make Emacs great, though, is its dedicated and\nhelpful user base. I hope to add a small contribution to that community with\nthis post, going over what I would have told my past self as I was just starting\nout using Emacs and trying to write my first Emacs configuration file.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Building Your First Emacs Config"},{"content":"In my opinion, the power of Emacs is that you\u0026rsquo;re able to program your own working environment. Other editors may be just as, or possibly more, efficient to use, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t come across any that give you control over as many aspects of your editor as Emacs does. Customising and tweaking your configuration may be an endless endeavour, but it\u0026rsquo;s also a highly rewarding one.\nAll that being said, I was inspired to tweak the look of my Org Mode setup, especially after reading the blog post Beautifying Org Mode in Emacs. Below you can find screenshots and code. I hope there\u0026rsquo;s something in here that you might want to steal for your own config! In case I change these settings later, my most recently updated config is always available on my GitHub.\nTheme The easiest and quickest way to change the look of vanilla Emacs is to load a colour theme. I\u0026rsquo;m using the doom-nord theme, which is part of the doom-themes package. I find both it and several of the other themes from that pack to be excellent.\nYou can find an updated list of themes on emacsthemes.com where they have screenshots. From spending time on the Emacs subreddit, I also know that people are very fond of Prot\u0026rsquo;s Modus and Ef themes, as well as the built-in leuven theme. Feel free to play around!\nFonts Next up is setting up variable-pitch and fixed-pitch fonts. I love Roboto Mono and I use a ligaturised version of it for programming, from the a-better-ligaturizer project. Here, I\u0026rsquo;ll add that a package such as ligature.el is required to display the ligatures.\nFor variable-pitch (regular) text, I want to use Source Sans Pro.\nIn my Emacs config, I have set these fonts outside the Org section, under \u0026ldquo;Interaction, Look \u0026amp; Feel\u0026rdquo;.\n(when (member \u0026#34;Roboto Mono\u0026#34; (font-family-list)) (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;default nil :font \u0026#34;Roboto Mono\u0026#34; :height 108) (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;fixed-pitch nil :family \u0026#34;Roboto Mono\u0026#34;)) (when (member \u0026#34;Source Sans Pro\u0026#34; (font-family-list)) (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;variable-pitch nil :family \u0026#34;Source Sans Pro\u0026#34; :height 1.18)) Then, back in the Org-specific part of the config, I resize the Org headings and choose Source Sans Pro to be the header font.\n;; Resize Org headings (dolist (face \u0026#39;((org-level-1 . 1.35) (org-level-2 . 1.3) (org-level-3 . 1.2) (org-level-4 . 1.1) (org-level-5 . 1.1) (org-level-6 . 1.1) (org-level-7 . 1.1) (org-level-8 . 1.1))) (set-face-attribute (car face) nil :font \u0026#34;Source Sans Pro\u0026#34; :weight \u0026#39;bold :height (cdr face))) ;; Make the document title a bit bigger (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;org-document-title nil :font \u0026#34;Source Sans Pro\u0026#34; :weight \u0026#39;bold :height 1.8) In order to avoid line spacing issues when a line of text contains both variable- and fixed-pitch text, we need to make sure that the org-indent face inherits from fixed-pitch.\n(require \u0026#39;org-indent) (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;org-indent nil :inherit \u0026#39;(org-hide fixed-pitch)) And then, we want to make sure that some parts of the Org document always use fixed-pitch even when variable-pitch-mode is on.\n(set-face-attribute \u0026#39;org-block nil :foreground nil :inherit \u0026#39;fixed-pitch :height 0.85) (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;org-code nil :inherit \u0026#39;(shadow fixed-pitch) :height 0.85) (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;org-indent nil :inherit \u0026#39;(org-hide fixed-pitch) :height 0.85) (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;org-verbatim nil :inherit \u0026#39;(shadow fixed-pitch) :height 0.85) (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;org-special-keyword nil :inherit \u0026#39;(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)) (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;org-meta-line nil :inherit \u0026#39;(font-lock-comment-face fixed-pitch)) (set-face-attribute \u0026#39;org-checkbox nil :inherit \u0026#39;fixed-pitch) For this all to come together, we need to make sure that variable-pitch-mode is always active in Org buffers.\n(add-hook \u0026#39;org-mode-hook \u0026#39;variable-pitch-mode) Also, if you\u0026rsquo;re having troubles with the size of LaTeX-previews like I did, you can increase the size like so.\n(plist-put org-format-latex-options :scale 2) Decluttering We\u0026rsquo;ll use \u0026ldquo;pretty entities\u0026rdquo;, which allow us to insert special characters LaTeX-style by using a leading backslash (e.g., \\alpha to write the greek letter alpha). org-ellipsis is the symbol displayed after an Org-heading that is collapsed - I prefer a simple dot.\n(setq org-adapt-indentation t org-hide-leading-stars t org-pretty-entities t org-ellipsis \u0026#34; ·\u0026#34;) For source code blocks specifically, I want Org to display the contents using the major mode of the relevant language. I also want TAB to behave inside the source code block like it normally would when writing code in that language.\n(setq org-src-fontify-natively t org-src-tab-acts-natively t org-edit-src-content-indentation 0) It\u0026rsquo;s common to hide emphasis markers (e.g., /.../ for italics, *...* for bold, etc.) to have a cleaner visual look, but this makes it harder to edit the text. org-appear is the solution to all my troubles. It displays the markers when the cursor is within them and hides them otherwise, making edits easy while looking pretty.\n(use-package org-appear :commands (org-appear-mode) :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode) :config (setq org-hide-emphasis-markers t) ; Must be activated for org-appear to work (setq org-appear-autoemphasis t ; Show bold, italics, verbatim, etc. org-appear-autolinks t ; Show links org-appear-autosubmarkers t)) ; Show sub- and superscripts And finally, I have some Org options to deal with headers and TODO\u0026rsquo;s nicely.\n(setq org-log-done t org-auto-align-tags t org-tags-column -80 org-fold-catch-invisible-edits \u0026#39;show-and-error org-special-ctrl-a/e t org-insert-heading-respect-content t) LaTeX Previews The LaTeX previews in Org mode are pretty small by default, so I\u0026rsquo;ll increase their size a little.\n(plist-put org-format-latex-options :scale 1.35) org-fragtog works like org-appear, but for LaTeX fragments: It toggles LaTeX previews on and off automatically, depending on the cursor position. If you move the cursor to a preview, it\u0026rsquo;s toggled off so you can edit the LaTeX snippet. When you move the cursor away, the preview is turned on again.\n(use-package org-fragtog :hook (org-mode-hook . org-fragtog-mode)) Centring \u0026amp; Line Breaks I want the text to fill the screen adaptively, so that long lines of text adapt to the size of the window. It also breaks lines instead of truncating them.\n(add-hook \u0026#39;org-mode-hook \u0026#39;visual-line-mode) I prefer having my Org buffer centred. I think it looks prettier when I only have one buffer open, and it\u0026rsquo;s barely noticeable when several are open because the width of the margins adapt. For this, I use Olivetti, which I think is a great package for this purpose.\n(add-hook \u0026#39;org-mode-hook \u0026#39;olivetti-mode) As you can see in the below screenshot, the Org document fills up the left side of the screen comfortably even when olivetti-mode is on.\nTask \u0026amp; Time Tracking Org mode is also a really powerful tool for tracking tasks and time usage. However, the default colours don\u0026rsquo;t go too well with our new look.\nOf course, you should change the keywords and the number of priorities to suit your tastes. I have lifted my colours straight from the official Nord theme pallette so that they go well with my preferred theme.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s set the number of task priorities and specify the colour for each priority.\n(setq org-lowest-priority ?F) ;; Gives us priorities A through F (setq org-default-priority ?E) ;; If an item has no priority, it is considered [#E]. (setq org-priority-faces \u0026#39;((65 . \u0026#34;#BF616A\u0026#34;) (66 . \u0026#34;#EBCB8B\u0026#34;) (67 . \u0026#34;#B48EAD\u0026#34;) (68 . \u0026#34;#81A1C1\u0026#34;) (69 . \u0026#34;#5E81AC\u0026#34;) (70 . \u0026#34;#4C566A\u0026#34;))) And then the custom keywords.\n(setq org-todo-keywords \u0026#39;((sequence \u0026#34;TODO(t)\u0026#34; \u0026#34;WAIT(w)\u0026#34; \u0026#34;READ(r)\u0026#34; \u0026#34;PROG(p)\u0026#34; ; Needs further action \u0026#34;|\u0026#34; \u0026#34;DONE(d)\u0026#34;))) ; Needs no action currently I don\u0026rsquo;t set the colours of each TODO state individually anymore, but if you wanted to, you could set the org-todo-keyword-faces variable like this:\n(setq org-todo-keyword-faces \u0026#39;((\u0026#34;TODO(t)\u0026#34; :inherit (org-todo region) :foreground \u0026#34;#A3BE8C\u0026#34; :weight bold) ...))
