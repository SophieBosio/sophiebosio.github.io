  content="I&amp;rsquo;m Sophie! I was born in Oslo in 1999, and after some moving back and forth for my studies, I&amp;rsquo;m back in my home city.
I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in programming, coffee, natural languages, and music.
Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying the wild ride of learning Emacs and preparing to write my MSc thesis, which will be on using program inversion to simplify automatic testing. By inverting your program, I hope to derive a good test input generator for you that you can feed to QuickCheck to automatically test your program with property-based tests, without having to write the generator by hand."

      <p>I&rsquo;m Sophie! I was born in Oslo in 1999, and after some moving back and forth
for my studies, I&rsquo;m back in my home city.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very interested in programming, coffee, natural languages, and music.</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m enjoying the wild ride of learning Emacs and preparing to write
my MSc thesis, which will be on using program inversion to simplify automatic
testing. By inverting your program, I hope to derive a good test input generator for you
that you can feed to QuickCheck to automatically test your program with
property-based tests, without having to write the generator by hand.</p>
<p>These days, I&rsquo;m really enjoying using Haskell, and that&rsquo;s the language I&rsquo;ll use
for my thesis as well.</p>
<p>Besides programming languages, I am also known to occasionally nerd out about
natural languages. In addition to Norwegian and English, I speak French and
Italian reasonably well.</p>
<p>I wanted to learn French because I have some family in
France and so I spent a year in Dijon trying to learn some more of the
language. During my bachelor&rsquo;s degree, I went to Bologna, Italy for an exchange
semester, where I had some courses in Italian. The Italian skills were doubly
useful because my French family is from a town bordering Italy, meaning I get
to practice both languages when I&rsquo;m visiting!</p>
